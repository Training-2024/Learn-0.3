# Learn-0.3
## OpenCV
You  guys might've finished the previous module, [Learn-0.2](https://github.com/Training-2024/Learn-0.2), if not, make sure you finish that first!<!--first finish that and then visit this module.-->Now we are going to start with **Computer Vision** also known as OpenCV.
OpenCV<!--Cv here is Computer Vision--> is a Python library which is designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV was originally developed in 1999 by Intel but later it was supported by Willow Garage.
OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java etc. Support for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
OpenCV Python is nothing but a wrapper class for the original C++ library to be used with Python. Using this, all of the OpenCV array structures gets converted to/from NumPy arrays.Dont get vexed with these names ðŸ¤£ ..you will learn it once after stepping into the main content.

As <!--previously-->told in the First Module, our **Robotics Club** <!--is promoting-->encourages and expects **_SELF LEARNING_**. So you guys might have understood what to do now...

This is the the second important & essential step in this whole Training-2024 Program. <!--So-->Learning OpenCV helps you to work with many Computer Vision related real world situations. Use these resources that we have curated for you to learn OpenCV.
